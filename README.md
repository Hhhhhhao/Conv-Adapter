# Conv-Adapter

Code for paper: ["Conv-Adapter: Exploring Parameter Efficient Transfer Learning for ConvNets"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07463).
Accepted by CVPR 2024, Prompting in Vision Workshop.


## Note
This is an very old code and I would suggest using only the models (with adapter modules) rather than using it for training or tuning.
